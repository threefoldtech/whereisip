# Where Is My IP

Small webservice using GeoLite2 database to give geographic information about IP address location

# Dependencies

This project depends on [MaxMind GeoLite2](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city)

# Build

Simply build the project with Go:
```go
go build
```

# Installation

First you need to copy a version of `GroLite2-City` database from MaxMind.
Copy this file into the same directory than `whereisip` binary: `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`

Then run the webservice: `./whereisip`

There is no command line arguments supported for now.

# Usage

Only one GET request to `/` is supported and you'll get a JSON response of GeoLite database content based on your remote address.
Server listen on `:8085`.
